Research of advertisements for the sale of apartments

At your disposal are data from the Yandex.Real Estate service - an archive of advertisements for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years. You need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate. Your job is to set the parameters. This will allow to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.

Two types of data are available for each apartment for sale. The first ones are entered by the user, the second ones are obtained automatically based on cartographic data. For example, the distance to the center, airport, nearest park and reservoir.
